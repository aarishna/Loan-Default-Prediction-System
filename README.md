# Loan Default Prediction System

A machine learning classifier with a circular linked-list–based navigation UI

# Overview

This project predicts whether borrowers are likely to default on a loan using a Decision Tree Classification Model. It features an interactive command-line navigation system built using a Circular Doubly Linked List, allowing users to move through borrower profiles with recommendation results (Accept / Reject).

This system combines data science and core data structure concepts into a single practical finance-based application.

 # Features

 Predictive Analytics using Decision Tree Classifier

 Automated preprocessing (noise filtering, missing value handling, feature scaling)

 Visual reports (histograms & pie charts) showing borrower trends

 Circular Doubly Linked List navigation for user-friendly record browsing

 Displays detailed borrower profiles with model-based recommendations

 Performance evaluation with accuracy, classification report & confusion matrix

## Tech Stack

Programming	Python
Machine Learning	Scikit-Learn
Data Handling	Pandas, NumPy

# How It Works

The dataset is cleaned and filtered

The classifier is trained on borrower indicators

Users can cycle through borrower records using:

n → next borrower

p → previous borrower

q → quit

Prediction displayed as:

# Accepted → low risk of default

# Rejected → high risk of default

# Model Insights

Shows financial risk distribution using Matplotlib visualizations

Highlights key contributors to default decisions
